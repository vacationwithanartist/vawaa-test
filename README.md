> Home page test for VAWAA tech lead

## Instructions
Put together the first few sections of a potential home page design in Vue as described here:

You may download a sketch file at the link above and/or use it directly for reference (up to and including "A Lifelong Souvenir").

Then, deploy the result to a service of your choice. The Nuxt.js docs are a good resource for various free services that are easy to deploy to.

Some notes:
1. Clicking the video thumbnail does not need to play.
2. The links should point to the artist pages at vawaa.com
3. You should use Vue, but feel free to change the component/directory structure as desired.


## Build Setup

Most of the resources/copy you need have been added to this repository. A call to VAWAA's API is included for the necessary dynamic data.  

``` bash
# clone this repo
git clone git@github.com:vacationwithanartist/vawaa-test.git

# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
